*FsSpec* is about writing executable specs in F#. Main intent is to provide readable DSL. Hope this tool will be able to achieve this. 

## Syntax

Syntax is heavy inspired by RSpec. Specification of the calculator could look like this:


    do describe "Calculator" [        

        it "should add two integers" (fun unit -> 

            let res = Calc.Add 2 2
            res.should_be_equal_to 4
        );


        it "should devide two integers" (fun unit -> 

            let res = Calc.Div 2 2
            res.should_be_equal_to 1
        );

    ]


## Usage

1. Reference FsSpec.dll;
2. Write specification

## Examples

There are two examples come out of the box. 

First one is located at `\src\Example\`, this is simple compiled spec. To run this spec, compile and run as regular command line app.

Second example on the other hand is implemented as bunch of F# scripts. You can find it at `\src\SuiteExample\`. Because of nature of the script, you do not have to compile it. Just execute Run.cmd. Should work.
